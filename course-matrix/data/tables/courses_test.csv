BIOB11H3,NAT_SCI,,"A course focusing on the central dogma of genetics and how molecular techniques are used to investigate cellular processes. Topics include structure and function of the nucleus, DNA replication and cell cycle control, transcription and translation, gene regulation and signal transduction.",,BIOA01H3 and BIOA02H3 and CHMA10H3 and CHMA11H3,BIO230H,Molecular Aspects of Cellular and Genetic Processes,,
BIOB12H3,NAT_SCI,University-Based Experience,"A practical introduction to experimentation in cell and molecular biology. Lab modules will introduce students to concepts and techniques in the general preparation of solutions and buffers, microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, microscopy, data analysis, and science communication. This core laboratory course is the gateway for Molecular Biology & Biotechnology Specialists to upper level laboratory offerings.",,CHMA10H3 and CHMA11H3,,Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory,BIOB10H3 and BIOB11H3,"Priority will be given to students enrolled in the Specialist programs in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (Co-op and non-Co-op), Medicinal and Biological Chemistry, Neuroscience (Stage 1, Co-op only), Neuroscience (Cellular/Molecular Stream), and the Major program in Biochemistry. Additional students will be admitted as space permits."
BIOB20H3,QUANT,,"This course explains the fundamental methods of quantitative reasoning, with applications in medicine, natural sciences, ecology and evolutionary biology. It covers the major aspects of statistics by working through concrete biological problems. The course will help students develop an understanding of key concepts through computer simulations, problem solving and interactive data visualisation using the R programming language (no prior skills with R or specialized math concepts are required).",,BIOA01H3 and BIOA02H3,BIO259H5,Introduction to Computational Biology,,
BIOB32H3,NAT_SCI,University-Based Experience,"This course examines physiological mechanisms that control and co-ordinate the function of various systems within the body. The laboratory exercises examine properties of digestive enzymes, characteristics of blood, kidney function, metabolic rate and energetics, nerve function and action potentials, synaptic transmission, skeletal muscle function and mechanoreception.",,,"BIO252Y, BIO270H, BIO271H, (ZOO252Y)",Animal Physiology Laboratory,(BIOB30H3) or BIOB34H3,
BIOB33H3,NAT_SCI,,A lecture based course with online learning modules which deals with the functional morphology of the human organism. The subject matter extends from early embryo-genesis through puberty to late adult life.,,[BIOA01H3 and BIOA02H3] or [HLTA03H3 and HLTA20H3],"ANA300Y, ANA301H, HLTB33H3, PMDB33H3",Human Development and Anatomy,,Priority will be given to students in the Human Biology programs. Additional students will be admitted as space permits.
BIOB34H3,NAT_SCI,,"An introduction to the principles of animal physiology rooted in energy usage and cellular physiology. A comparative approach is taken, which identifies both the universal and unique mechanisms present across the animal kingdom. Metabolism, thermoregulation, digestion, respiration, water regulation, nitrogen excretion, and neural circuits are the areas of principal focus.",,BIOA01H3 and BIOA02H3 and CHMA11H3,BIO270H,Animal Physiology,,

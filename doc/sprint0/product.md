## III. Why should User Choose This Product
### 1.Time Saving and Convenience
Currently, UTSC students must navigate multiple platforms (e.g., the UTSC timetable, course description pages, and ACORN) to plan courses and confirm their availability. Course Matric saves users time and streamlines the course research process by centralizing these functionalities into one location. Its AI assistant allows users to interact in normal English while still being able to fully utilise the help and tools provided with little to no instructions. Users can also manually customize their timetables and acquire academic information from a single location.

### 2.Flexibility and Personalization
Existing time management tools UTSC provides lack flexibility and options for customization and personalization. On the other hand, third-party timetable providers, while allowing for more customization and personalization, do not have access to the UTSC course database, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies. 
Course Matrix will bridge this gap by allowing users to:
- Provide critical information to the course-generating algorithm and receive suggested timetables before selecting the best options
- Manually adjust the schedule based on personal preferences
- Communicate with the AI assistant to automatically generate timetables.
### 3. Error Reduction
A centralized database could also help users avoid critical mistakes, such as missing courses with low offering frequency or important academic information due to the volume of provided information on traditional pages.

### 4. Enhanced Coordination
Sharing and comparing schedules is often cumbersome with existing tools. Course Matrix simplifies this by offering:
- Seamless timetables sharing via internal system or external links.
- Easier group project coordination as users' schedules can be compared side-by-side.

## IV. Product Acceptance Criteria
A fully completed Course Matrix will include: 
- **Secure User Authorization**: Robust account management and data privacy features allow users to have full control over their accounts and data.
- **AI Personal Assistant**: Engaging and accurate with the ability to provide course details and timetable generation.
- **Course generating algorithm**: Analyzing user's input to automatically generate different timetable suggestions.
- **Comprehensive Course Database**: Filterable by key criteria such as prerequisites, exclusions, department, etc.
- **Timetable Management Tools**: Customizable timetables, sharing options and detailed visualization features.
- **Email Notification System**: Alerts for important academic events and deadlines.

## V. Product Discussion Highlight
### 1. Identifying the Problem
Our team observed several challenges UTSC students face when organizing their academic lives:
- **Inefficiency**: Students often spend hours especially at the beginning of each semester researching course information, availability, and suitability with their degree requirements across different websites. Current platforms such as ACORN do not support overlaid course visualization, students must switch between different tabs to change the course options before seeing it populated on their timetable.
- **Course Selection/Academic Journey Planning**: UTSC provide a wide range of courses with different requirements thus making it difficult for students to find suitable courses or might miss courses that are aligned with their interests, needs or preferences.
### 2.Brainstorming Solution
We discussed ways to reduce these stress points and identified the need for a centralized tool. After considering other potential ideas, like a sports tracking app, we chose to focus on a course planning platform that could significantly improve the academic experience for UTSC students.

This platform offers immediate and practical benefits for students, addressing common pain points and simplifying the academic journey. Course Matrix was designed to be a reliable and intelligent companion for students throughout their time at UTSC.
### 3. Team organization
Effective communication is central to our teamâ€™s strategy for collaboration. We schedule meetings three times a week (Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday) to maintain momentum, discuss progress, and ensure alignment across tasks.

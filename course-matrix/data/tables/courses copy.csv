Music is also a significant technology of “remembering in everyday life,” a storehouse of our memories. In this course we examine acts of popular music preservation and consider questions such as: what happens when museums house popular music exhibitions? Who has the authority to narrate popular music, and how does popular music become a site of cultural heritage? Throughout this course, we will work with a notion of “heritage” as an act that brings the past into conversation with the present and can powerfully operate to bring people together while simultaneously excluding others or strategically forgetting. We will spend time with bottom-up heritage projects and community archives to better understand how memory is becoming democratized beyond large cultural institutions. As more and more cultural heritage becomes digitally born, new possibilities and new risks emerge for the preservation of popular music cultures.",,"1.0 credit at the B-level from the following: MUZB01H3, MUZB20H3, or MUZB80H3",,"Issues in Popular Music: Heritage, Preservation & Archives",,

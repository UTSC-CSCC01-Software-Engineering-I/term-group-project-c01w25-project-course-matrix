    - Ticket details include: estimated story point to determine its priority, assignees

    ![Ticket Detail](./images/Ticket_Detail.png)

    - Tickets of large user stories will be broken down into smaller child issues

    ![Ticket Description and Child Issue](./images/Ticket_Description_and_Child_Issue.png)

    - Each ticket will also show:

      - Other tickets blocked by it

## III. Why should User Choose This Product

### 2.Flexibility and Personalization
The platform allows users to:
- Provide critical information to the course-generating algorithm and receive suggested timetables, manually adjust the schedule based on personal preferences or communicate with the AI assistant to automatically generate timetables.

### 3. Error Reduction
A centralized database could also help users avoid critical mistakes such as missing courses with low offering frequency or important academic information due to the volume of provided information from traditional pages.

## V. Product Discussion Highlight
### 1. Identifying the Problem
Our team observed several challenges UTSC students face when organizing their academic lives:
- **Inefficiency**: Students often spend hours especially at the beginning of each semester researching course information, availability, and suitability with their degree requirements across different websites. Current platforms such as ACORN do not support overlaid course visualization, students must switch between different tabs to change the course options before seeing it populated on their timetable.
- **Course Selection/Academic Journey Planning**: UTSC provide a wide range of courses with different requirements thus making it difficult for students to find suitable courses or might miss courses that are aligned with their interests, needs or preferences.
### 2.Brainstorming Solution
We discussed ways to reduce these stress points and identified the need for a centralized tool. After considering other potential ideas, like a sports tracking app, we chose to focus on a course planning platform that could significantly improve the academic experience for UTSC students.

This platform offers immediate and practical benefits for students, addressing common pain points and simplifying the academic journey. Course Matrix was designed to be a reliable and intelligent companion for students throughout their time at UTSC.

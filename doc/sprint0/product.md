## III. Why should User Choose This Product
### 1. Time Saving and Convenience
Currently, UTSC students must navigate multiple platforms (e.g., the UTSC timetable, course description pages, and ACORN) to plan courses and confirm their availability. Course Matrix saves users time and streamlines the course research process by centralizing these functionalities into one location. Its AI assistant allows users to interact in normal English while still being able to fully utilise the help and tools provided with little to no instructions. Users can also manually customize their timetables and acquire academic information from a single location. Instead of spending a week gathering all the available course options and trying to fit them into a rigid timetable for visual representation of the next four months, users can easily communicate with the AI agent to receive numerous recommendations on how to effectively schedule different activities throughout the days within minutes.
### 2. Flexibility and Personalization
The time management tools currently provided by UTSC lack the flexibility and customization options that students often need. While third-party timetable providers offer more personalization features, they lack integration with the UTSC course database, leading to inefficiencies and a higher likelihood of errors.
Course Matrix addresses these challenges by bridging the gap with features that allow users to:
- Input key information into the course-generating algorithm to receive tailored timetable suggestions.
- Manually adjust schedules to align with personal preferences.
- Leverage an AI assistant for automated timetable creation.

By centralizing these functions, Course Matrix eliminates the need for students to juggle multiple websites and information sources, enabling them to manage both their academic and personal lives through a single, cohesive timetable. Additionally, robust personalization options allow users to customize the visual layout of their schedules for clarity and practicality, making the platform more intuitive and user-friendly.
### 3. Error Reduction
A centralized database helps users avoid critical errors, such as overlooking courses with limited availability or missing essential academic details often buried in traditional platforms. Consolidating information in one place eliminates the need to manually transfer data between pages, reducing the risk of human errors like incorrect lecture times or course codes.
### 4. Enhanced Coordination
Sharing and comparing schedules is often cumbersome with existing tools. Course Matrix simplifies this by offering:
- Seamless timetables sharing via internal system or external links.
- Easier group project coordination as users' schedules can be compared side-by-side.

## V. Product Discussion Highlight
### 1. Identifying the Problem
Our team identified several key challenges UTSC students encounter when managing their academic schedules:
- **Inefficiency**: Â Students often spend hours, particularly at the start of each semester, navigating multiple websites to research course details, availability, and alignment with degree requirements. Moreover, platforms like ACORN lack features such as overlaid course visualization, requiring students to switch between tabs to explore options before seeing how they fit into their timetables.
- **Course Selection and Academic Journey Planning**: UTSC offers a diverse range of courses with varying prerequisites and requirements, making it challenging for students to identify suitable options. This complexity increases the risk of students overlooking courses that align with their academic goals, interests, or preferences.
- **Limited Time Management Tools**: The current UTSC timetable system only displays enrolled courses and lacks options for adding additional activities or customizing the layout to suit individual preferences. This rigidity reduces its practicality. Furthermore, the absence of functionality to test different course combinations makes it difficult for students to explore and choose the most effective schedule.
### 2. Brainstorming Solution
We explored various solutions to address these challenges and identified the need for a centralized platform equipped with interactive tools that empower students to create personalized schedules efficiently.
One alternative considered was developing an Outlook-style timetable, where users could block time slots for activities or events and overlay their schedules with team members to identify mutual availability for group meetings. However, this approach lacked integration with the UTSC course database, limiting its utility. Users would still need to manually search for available courses and their details, rather than benefiting from automated recommendations or a visual preview of how selected courses fit into their existing schedules.
The Course Matrix platform addresses these gaps by offering immediate, practical solutions that simplify academic planning and decision-making. Designed to be a smart and reliable companion, it helps students navigate their academic journeys more effectively throughout their time at UTSC.
### 3. Team organization
Effective communication is central to our team's strategy for collaboration. We schedule meetings three times a week (Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday) to maintain momentum, discuss progress, and ensure alignment across tasks.

## III. Why should User Choose This Product
### 1.Time Saving and Convenience
Course Matric combines the functionality of multiple platforms into one location. It also provides an AI assistant so that users can interact in normal English but still be able to fully utilise the help and tools provided with little to no instructions. If needed users can also manually customize their timetables, track academic progress from a single location

### 2.Flexibility and Personalization
The platform allows users to
    - Adjust schedules based on personal preferences or provide personal preferences for the AI personal assistant to automatically generate timetables and meeting schedules.
    - Suggested timetable will factor in the travel time between lecture locations
    - The AI assistant could analyze past data to predict courses' next offering thus improving plan accuracy and avoiding time and money wasted on unnecessary course selection.

### 3. Error Reduction
Better course predicting accuracy and a centralized database could also help users avoid critical mistakes such as missing courses with low offering frequency or scheduling back-to-back courses that are located far away from each other.

### 4. Enhanced Coordination
Sharing timetables with peers and scheduling group projects or meetings with professors becomes easier as their schedules could be overlaid directly on the user's timetable.

## IV. Product Acceptance Criteria
A fully completed Course Matrix will include:
    - **Comprehensive Course Database**: Could be filtered using critical criteria: courses' prerequisites, exclusions, degree requirements, and department-specific offerings.
    - **Functional AI personal assistant**: Who could engage in conversation with users to provide the needed help including timetable and meeting schedule generation, critical course and degree information.
    - **User-friendly interface**: Intuitive UI allows users to use the website with little instructions.
    - **Email Notification**: For important academic progress, deadlines and degree requirements
## V. Product Discussion Highlight
### 1. Identifying the Problem
Our team observed several challenges UTSC students face when organizing their academic lives
    - **Inefficiency**: Students often spend hours especially at the beginning of each semester researching course information, availability, and suitability with their degree requirements across different websites.
    - **Uncertainty**: Students do not always know how often a course is offered thus planning to take it in terms where it is not available or do not meet the course requirements in the one term it is offered
    - **Course Selection/Academic Journey Planning**: UTSC provide a wide range of courses with different requirements thus making it difficult for students to find suitable courses or might miss courses that are aligned with their interests, needs or preferences.
### 2.Brainstorming Solution
We discussed ways to reduce these stress points and identified the need for a centralized tool. After considering other potential ideas, like a sports tracking app, we chose to focus on a course planning platform that could significantly improve the academic experience for UTSC students.

This platform offers immediate and practical benefits for students, addressing common pain points and simplifying the academic journey. Course Matrix was designed to be a reliable and intelligent companion for students throughout their time at UTSC.

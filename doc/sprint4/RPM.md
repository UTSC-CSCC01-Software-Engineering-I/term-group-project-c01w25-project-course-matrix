### 2.4 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Testing**

  - Further integration and unit tests need to be added for both our frontend and backend

- **CI/CD Workflow**
  - We need a CI/CD pipeline for our application so that only the latest functional version of our application is running at all times.

### 2.5 Dependencies and Limitations

- The AI assistant relies on querying an external vector database and OpenAI. Bothe of these are online resources so if they are down our feature will be down as well.
- The Timetable relies solely on the internal course database and installed dependencies. It does not fetch web-based content.
- Unit testing relies solely on internal functions and installed dependencies. It does not fetch any web-based content.
- The deployment relies on fetching the latest project version from github and (if it passes all unit tests) deploys the latest version on our google cloud virtual machine instance using docker hub storing the various images of our application.
